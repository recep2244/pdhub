# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** A reliable, end-to-end protein design workflow where a researcher goes from sequence to structure to expert analysis to mutagenesis to report without data loss, silent failures, or manual workarounds.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Mutagenesis Workflow Integrity

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Mutagenesis Workflow Integrity)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-21 — Plan 02-01 complete: Phase 1-to-Phase 2 approval gate enforced in mutation scanner

Progress: [###░░░░░░░] 15%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-git-and-code-health | 2 | 6 min | 3 min |
| 02-mutagenesis-workflow-integrity | 1 | 12 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2 min), 01-02 (4 min), 02-01 (12 min)
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- qwen2.5:14b as default LLM (best quality/fit for 12 GB VRAM)
- Phase 1/Phase 2 mutagenesis split (allows user review before expensive execution) — approval gate not yet enforced, Phase 2 fixes this
- OST comprehensive scoring per mutant flagged for revisit — Phase 3 addresses cap/optional flag
- [01-01] *.bak confirmed safe to delete: current 10_mutation_scanner.py is superset of .bak (contains _render_manual_tab_settings() refactor)
- [01-01] *.bak added to Temporary files section of .gitignore alongside *.tmp
- [01-02] Canonical class name is MutagenesisPipelineReportAgent (fixes missing 's' typo in MutagenesiReportAgent)
- [01-02] Backward-compatible alias MutagenesiReportAgent = MutagenesisPipelineReportAgent kept at module level
- [02-01] _run_phase2() guard checks both empty approved_mutations AND the _phase2_confirmed sentinel so dialog bypass is allowed without a hard block
- [02-01] Inline st.error shown unconditionally when zero mutations selected (above disabled button) as persistent UX hint
- [02-01] Sentinel _phase2_confirmed reset AFTER calling _run_phase2() in bypass path (not before) to ensure guard sees True value

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~`mutagenesis_agents.py` is untracked in git~~ — RESOLVED by 01-01
- ~~Class name typo MutagenesiReportAgent (missing 's')~~ — RESOLVED by 01-02
- ~~Missing approval gate between mutagenesis Phase 1 and Phase 2 is a live correctness bug~~ — RESOLVED by 02-01
- No Phase 1 to Phase 2 integration test — Phase 4 adds it; Phases 2-3 must complete first so there is correct behavior to test

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-21
Stopped at: Completed 02-01-PLAN.md (approval gate: button renamed, @st.dialog confirmation, _run_phase2 guard, sentinel pattern, 46 tests pass)
Resume file: None
